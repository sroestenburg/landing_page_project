## Landing page project
The landing page project consists of a menu with four sections, and uses javascript to detect if additional sections have been added, and dynamically re-does the menu with the section changes, an active state on the nav items is shown when a section is in the viewport. Also when clicking on a nav item, it scrolls to the appropriate section of the page.

## Custom css
Custom css can be found at css/*.css

## Custom javascript
The custom javascript can be found in the folder js/app.js




For this project I have put in practice the use of the for... of loop 

```javascript
for(const element of collection){
    console.log(element)
}
```

I also put in practice the use of classList
```javascript
classList.contains
classList.add
classList.remove
```
and EventListeners 
``` javascript
document.addEventListener("scroll", showTopBtnAndStickyNavbar);

goToTopbutton.addEventListener("click", scrollToTop);
```
